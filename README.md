# Reinforcement Learning

A collection of reinforcement learning projects undertaken during the Fall 2023 semester.

These projects mainly investigate verious reinforcement learning methods and apply them to various problems, like the Bandit problem and the Gambler's problem, and are implemented in Python with `numpy` and some visualization libraries. These projects led to a research project to investigate the use of RL techniques for discovery on a planetary body, advised in collaboration with NASA; find that project [https://github.com/papillonlibre/RL-Scientific-Discovery](here).
